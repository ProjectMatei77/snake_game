Snake Game


This is a classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. 
In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food to grow in size while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. 
The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself. After the game ends, you can restart it from a popup window.

Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake's movement using the W, A, S, and D keys.
Food: The snake grows each time it eats food, and the score increases.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
Restart Option: After the game ends, a popup window appears, giving the player the option to restart the game.
